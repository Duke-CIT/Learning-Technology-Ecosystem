# 1 - Defining the Paradigm Shift
![Services](/resources/Services.png)
Services that make up part of today's Duke learning experience.

## For Technologists
* it's two lines of business, the LMS isn't going away tomorrow. You're running a DLX technology stack alongside your LMS.

## For Students


## For Faculty


## DLX - Designed Learning eXperience
Users use a wide variety of tools in their everyday life, the tools update regularly, the users switch between them regularly.

Users want this agency in their learning experience. They want intuitive variety of their choosing.

This doesn't mean the LMS goes away, it does shift priorities away from it.

This doesn't mean we focus on making things 'prettier', it does mean we focus on the whole teaching and learning experience.

The smart phone is a good metaphor. Users are provided a default set of apps, like Safari, that represent the starting point, not the majority of functionality the phone is capable of.

They are also presented with an app store containing varied means of introducing new functionality and apps, like Chrome and Firefox, to them.

App developers use Application Programming Interfaces or APIs to bridge the gap between their ideas and users. APIs give developers the power to do almost anything

The learning technology ecosystem will contain all the pieces of this metaphor. 

* default apps (like the LMS or Box)
* app store (curated lists of approved or supported apps)
* app developers (both in and outside the university)
* APIs (connection points for users and app developers to customize their experience)

This results in a very specifically designed user experience the first time each user picks up a new phone and tremendous agency to customize that experience to meet their needs.

## Design for the edges
[Harvard Faculty, Todd Rose](https://youtu.be/4eBmyttcfU4) - Actually not about technology, but course design.

```
]]         Innovators
]]]]       Early Adopters
]]]]]]     Early Majority
]]]]       Late Majority
]]         Laggards
```

### Innovators
Innovators aren't always techno-geeks, they're just risk takers. Capitalize on their energy and interest for what's next. They are the ones asking questions.
Innovators are the key to getting early adopters, they are your passionate advocates.

### Early Adopters


### Early and Late Majority
The trickle-down effect continues, early adopters help persuade the early majority.

These will continue to use the status quo until they see enough of their friends/colleagues doing something new or have other impetus to change.

Some are more techno-literate than others, but they are averse to risk and change. Spending time forcing change here is not well placed. This is fine, because we're not going to rip out the LMS from under them. The LMS continues to exist alongside and part of the ecosystem.

### Laggards
Designing intuitive solutions for laggard users gives you an option than any user might find valuable. It may also be a more influential starting point for gaining late majority users than innovators.

This doesn't necessarily mean you end up with one solution for both innovators and laggards. It means you focus on those two groups' experiences and design solution to meet their needs.
