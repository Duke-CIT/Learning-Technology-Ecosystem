DLX

* learner focused
* UI separate from content separate from backend
* api driven
* delivers sound digital pedagogies only
* personalized
	* users select the way they want to learn material
	* so material is built to be delivered in a multitude of ways
	* for pilot this may mean a single build by content experts manually converted to other means if apis cannot handle the task
	* what standards are required?
	* Authentication - MG & OIT
		* shibboleth
		* LTI
		* OAuth
	* Content - need resources
		* HTML and JSON
	* Data - need resources
		* XAPI
		* Caliper
		*  dispositional (e.g., incoming GPA, biographic and demographic data)
		*  course activity and engagement, (e.g., keystrokes, selections, time on task)
		*  learner artifacts (e.g., essays, blog posts, media products)
*  Analytics are robust, student has agency to export and integrate additional data sources
	* student empowerment
	* continuous instructional improvement

	* this is why nursing could be appealing. Can we get a program to buy into this mindset?  
* Connects the learner 
	* inside and outside dlx
	* what's closed and what's open? - need resources
* 

Course design process similar to MOOC

1. faculty provide current course content
2. course design team reformats the content to fit DLX
3. faculty approves DLX


Possible technologies

* etherpad for google docs like collaboration? what's their API like?
* PlayPosit for media
