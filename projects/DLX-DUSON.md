# DLX for DUSON

An experiment to deliver one version of a Next Generation Digital Learning Environment (NGDLE) Minimum Viable Product (MVP). 


* learner focused
* UI separate from content separate from backend
* api driven
* delivers sound digital pedagogies only
* personalized
  * users select the way they want to learn material
  * so material is built to be delivered in a multitude of ways
  * for pilot this may mean a single build by content experts manually converted to other means if apis cannot handle the task
  * what standards are required?
  * Authentication - MG & OIT
    * shibboleth
    * LTI
    * OAuth
  * Content - need resources
    * HTML and JSON
  * Data - need resources
    * XAPI
    * Caliper
    * dispositional \(e.g., incoming GPA, biographic and demographic data\)
    * course activity and engagement, \(e.g., keystrokes, selections, time on task\)
    * learner artifacts \(e.g., essays, blog posts, media products\)
* Analytics are robust, student has agency to export and integrate additional data sources
  * student empowerment
  * continuous instructional improvement
  * institutional oversight  
* Presents a program length experience
  * this is why nursing could be appealing. Can we get a program to buy into this mindset?  
* Connects the learner 
  * inside and outside dlx
  * what's closed and what's open? - need resources
* 
Course design process similar to MOOC

1. faculty provide current course content
2. course design team reformats the content to fit DLX
3. faculty approves DLX

Possible technologies

* etherpad for google docs like collaboration? what's their API like?
* PlayPosit for media
*
